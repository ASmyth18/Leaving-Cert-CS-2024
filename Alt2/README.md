The recommended way to run the alt 2 code is by importing it to kaggle but simply running vscode(or thonny) as long as you have jupyter installed is an alternative 
To run in Thonny please install the 'jupyter' package
To install the libraries use pip install -r requirements.txt
Please keep in mind if your python version is 3.11 or greater the catboost library is incompatible and therefore you either regress your python version or run on kaggle
