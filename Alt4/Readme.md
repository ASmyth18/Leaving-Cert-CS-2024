Alt 4 prompts the student with the following

> Students will implement a microprocessor system that uses sensors and controls digital inputs and outputs

I have decided to provide two separate scripts for the learning task. The first project utilises an Arduino, some external sensors and c++. The second project utilises a Micro:Bit and MicroPython.

Arduino req:

- Arduino Uno board
- Arduino IDE
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
- PIR motion sensor
- LED
- Buzzer
- Breadboard and jumper wires

Micro:Bit requirements

- Micro:Bit(V2)
